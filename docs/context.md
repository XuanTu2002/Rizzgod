### 1. Project Breakdown

**App Name:** Rizzgod  
**Platform:** Web  
**Summary:** Rizzgod is an AI-powered web application designed to help users craft witty and engaging responses for dating apps like Tinder and Bumble. Users can upload screenshots of their chat conversations or input a bio of the person they want to flirt with, and the AI will generate clever, context-aware replies instantly. The app aims to enhance users' dating experiences by providing real-time, personalized suggestions that improve their chances of making meaningful connections.  

**Primary Use Case:**  
- Users upload screenshots of dating app chats or input a bio.  
- The AI analyzes the content and generates witty, contextually relevant responses.  
- Users can copy the generated lines and use them directly in their dating app conversations.  

**Authentication Requirements:**  
- Users can sign up or log in using email/password or OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) via Supabase authentication.  
- Authentication is required to save user preferences, chat history, and favorite responses for future use.

### 6. Technical Implementation Approach

1. **Frontend (React + Next.js):**  
   - Use Next.js API routes to handle AI API requests and Supabase interactions.  
   - Create reusable components for the upload form, response cards, and user dashboard.  

2. **UI (Tailwind CSS + ShadCN):**  
   - Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and ShadCN for pre-built components like modals and buttons.  
   - Implement a responsive design using Tailwind's breakpoints.  

3. **Backend (Supabase):**  
   - Set up Supabase for user authentication and data storage.  
   - Use Supabase Edge Functions to handle AI API requests and process user inputs.  
   - Enable real-time updates for chat history and favorites.  

4. **Deployment (Vercel):**  
   - Deploy the app on Vercel with automatic CI/CD integration.
